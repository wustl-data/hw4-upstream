## Collaborators
> Use this section to list any collaborators on your assignment and describe their contributions.

## Code Annotation
> To help me evaluate your code, use this section to describe any aspects of your submission that take an unusual approach or are otherwise noteworthy, such as usage of third party packages, usage of a different programming language, any settings I would need to configure or commands I need to run outside of what was instructed. 

## Getting Started

Remember, you have 3 options to get started on an assignment: GitHub Codespaces, local Dev Container, or a traditional local environment.

### GitHub Codespaces (Option 1 - Recommended)
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the **Open with Codespaces** option.
2. Select **+ New codespace** at the bottom on the pane.

For more information on creating your codespace, visit the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace).

### Dev Container (Option 2)

1. Make sure you have Docker, VS Code, and the Remote Containers extension for VS Code installed.

2. Copy the clone URL for your assignment's repository.

3. From VS Code, run the Command Pallet (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select **Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Named Volume**. Browse to your assignment's repository and select it. Name the volume something you can use for the duration of the class (e.g. wrangling-FL22). Treat this volume like your hard drive and don't delete it unless you have everything backed up.

More detail about devcontainer setup can be found in the [VS Code Documentation]https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume).

### Local environment (Option 3)

With your own local environment setup, clone the repo and open the folder in your IDE. Don't forget to install your package dependencies.
